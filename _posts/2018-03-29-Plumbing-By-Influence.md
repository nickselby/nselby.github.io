<h1>The Limits of Corporate Culture</h1>

<p><img class="right" width="327px" src="https://nselby.github.io/assets/img/plumber.png" /></p>

A human resources guy I respect said something today that really hit home: when you're discussing corporate values, listing the word, "Integrity" is really odd - if you need to list <em>that</em> as a corporate value, you're really starting behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_landing_system" target="_blank">meatball</a> in terms of your hiring. I mean, we should be able to presume <em>something</em>, right? 

Corporate values are an important part of corporate culture, and corporate culture is hugely important. I have no data to back this up, but I suspect cultural debt is as expensive for a company to fix as technical debt - it's something you want to spend a lot of time considering so you accrue as little as possible. 

But there are limits to cultural influence. There are some things at a company that, like integrity, one simply must be able to presume, or else you are well behind the meatball.

This shouldn't be a difficult concept - not everything you do at your company should be dependent on cultural fit, or influence. For example, plumbing: you don't want a plumber to try through influence to fix a leak. As Stanley Motss so eloquently put it, "You do your job right and nobody should notice. But when you fuck it up, everything gets full of shit."

Information security, and infrastructure deployment, are in the same category. Sure, there are vast areas of both in which cultural deference and the politics of influence must take precedence. When a new procedure will provide an incremental improvement, you don't get people to change long-established habits by shouting at them or calling them stupid. 

But if the issue is existential? Or if the issue is the difference between a breach or not a breach? 

I got yer culture right here. 

If a company wants to get from a bad place to a good one, culture takes a back seat to getting a paycheck. There are simply things that must get done to move from bad to good. Many of these can be culturally jarring. Breaking single-points-of-failure (often well-intentioned people who have become so central as to be irreplacable to certain processes) means that the person who is a single point of failure will often feel marginalized and unappreciated. 

Interestingly, and counter-intuitively, I have never found a person who had become a single-point-of-failure (SPOF) who was happy to learn he would have less work to do. When I show up and say, "Let's make it so that you are not the single point of failure; I mean, what if you get hit by a bus?" it's always misinterpreted as some kind of rebuke. 

It's read not as an indictment of the operations management that led to someone to feel it a requirement to just stand up and do ... everything. Instead, it's taken as an accusation that the person who has become the SPOF somehow engineered it that way. 

Often, that couldn't be further from the truth.

But in any event, breaking that SPOF and democratizing the process will almost certainly lead to hurt feelings, and often, to someone quitting. 

And here I do not mean to be insensitive, but: Good. 

Information security is difficult to understand, and I have no truck with those who can't see the way forward. But if you are told that security is threatened; that the company risks becoming an <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/equifax-confirms-more-americans-were-affected-by-hack-than-first-thought/" target="_blank">Equifax</a> or an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-great-brain-robbery-china-cyber-espionage/" target="_blank">American Semiconductor</a>, and you refuse to budge? 

The company is better - and will survive and thrive - without you.

The people who stay are better without you and, perversely, they will accomplish more without your dead weight.
 

Some things require brute force, and a senior executive commitment to change.

Some things actually are, "Do this or you'll die." 

Some things - plumbing, infrastructure, cyber-security - are better sometimes without deference to culture. Not always. Not even a lot. 

Understanding when this is true is an art.
