<h1>Data, versus Numbers, versus Proof</h1>
<p><img class="left" width="400px" src="https://jimsulecki.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/favim-com-26303.jpg?w=400&h=253&crop=1" /></p>

<p>In The Atlantic last week I wrote a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/07/death-by-police-contd/491216/" target="_blank">fairly detailed dissent</a> to Adrienne LaFrance's article on police killing. This is to add to that.</p>

<p>None of the statements in that dissent (<em>including</em> my mention of the findings of Mr. Fryer, see below) was to suggest that there is a “correct” number, and I think that <em>that</em> is my overall point.</p> 

<p>I <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/07/death-by-police-contd/491216/" target="_blank">wrote</a>,</p>

<blockquote>So now comes Roland G. Fryer, Jr., a frickin’ genius at Harvard who just released, as you noted earlier this week, a study titled “An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force.” The beauty of this study (it’s a working paper, covered gushingly in The New York Times) is actually not the conclusions, but the methodology. Even if you’ve never read a methodology section before, I urge you to read his. His method of capture of narrative into coded data was simply wonderful—in that, for the first time, someone took the trouble to treat police data like most other data.</blockquote>

<p>I was remiss in that dissent (which was, after all, 1800 words) not to mention the excellent work of Cody Ross (“<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0141854" target="_blank">A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011–2014</a>”) in PLOS, which looks to the <a href="https://us-police-shootings-database.silk.co/" target="_blank">U.S. Police-Shooting Database</a> (USPSD) for answers to these questions and found "significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the probability of being {black, unarmed, and shot by police} is about 3.49 times the probability of being {white, unarmed, and shot by police} on average.</p> 

<p>I have a panoply of bones to pick with the USPSD, but not with Mr. Ross' superb analysis but <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/2016/07/crime-incarceration/bayes-race-and-police-killing/" target="_blank">W. David Ball has done an extraordinary analysis of that</a>, plus a description of Bayesian analysis in general and a super-cool critique of the Fryer paper in particular.  <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2016/07/14/about-that-claim-that-police-are-less-likely-to-shoot-blacks-than-whites/" target="_blank">Andrew Gelman's blog</a> had a terrific analysis of the same piece, and  Uri Simonsohn went to town on the specifics of some of the <a href="http://datacolada.org/50" target="_blank">data assumptions that raised his eyebrows towards K2</a>.</p>

<p>And then, last week, came Radley Balko, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/07/14/why-its-impossible-to-calculate-the-percentage-of-police-shootings-that-are-legitimate/" target="_blank">wrote in his superb The Watch blog at the Post</a>, that it is quite simply impossible to calculate the percentage of police shootings that are legitimate.</p>

<p>Radley and I spoke (he got the 74% analysis only partly right in his column, believing mistakenly that the 16% I mentioned in my note were part of the 74% of killings that interrupted a fatal attack).</p>


<p>The reason the Fryer paper, and Fatal Encounters, and the Ross paper, and David Bell's critique, and <a href="https://github.com/StreetCredSoftware/PKIC" target="_blank">StreetCred Police Killings in Context</a> database, and <a href="http://amzn.to/1q0pkXx" target="_blank">my book</a> are so important is that they are serious attempts to take almost comically imperfect data about monumentally complex, insanely multi-variate situations and dive in to one or two aspects of them in a way that can provide meaningful insight. </p>

<p>If you were to put together a list of the most serious people looking at these issues, I think that all those names I just mentioned, plus those I've mentioned throughout this note would certainly be in the Top 20. </p>

<p>And the fact is that we can geek the hell out over these numbers and grant points and get great takeaways, but I buried the lede and it is worth repeating:</p>

<p>Law enforcement data is the one place where Occam’s Razor does not apply. Journalists who state facts based on studies do so at their peril.</p>
