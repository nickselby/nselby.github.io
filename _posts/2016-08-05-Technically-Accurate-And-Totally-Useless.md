<h1>Technically Accurate and Useless</h1>
<p><img class="left" width="400px" src="http://eeiengineers.com/images/Image/projects/office/microsoft-office-bldg.jpg" /></p>

<p>The other day during an argument on Twitter, a journalist told me that his exceptionally misleading headline was "technically accurate." I retorted that that was true, but it was also useless. </p>

<p>"Headlines," according to the journalism school at North Dakota State University, "need to be accurate, first, and to fairly reflect the theme of the story." A headline that lures you in by promising something and failing to deliver is called, "Clickbait" - and it is a cheesy trick of those without ethics.</p>

<p>During the argument, the reporter said that this headline was accurate:</p>

<p>"Korryn Gaines is the ninth black woman shot and killed by police this year."</p>

<p>While accurate, the story was about a long standoff between the police and Gaines, who had a shotgun and was threatening to kill police. The story then discussed unjustified killings by police of black women in general. The impliction that Gaines' killing by police was unjustified seems to be at the very least a stretch - as evidence is revealed, her behavior was consistent with someone who adopted a criminal lifestyle and anti-government philosophy common among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement" target="_blank">soveriegn citizens</a>.</p>

<p>After the argument, the reporter changed the headline to this: "Korryn Gaines, cradling child and shotgun, is fatally shot by police." That's a headline. </p>

<p>Here's my point about technically correct but useless in the form of a joke. </p>

<p>A helicopter pilot is flying one passenger around Seattle, and suddenly they get fogged in. The GPS isn't working. The pilot sees a big, flashy office building nearby so he goes over and hovers very close to the windows. A crowd gathers inside the building, with workers looking at the chopper.</p>

<p>The pilot takes a big piece of paper and writes, "Where am I?", then presses it against the cockpit glass so the people inside can wee it. Some workers squint to read it, then they discuss it, get a piece of paper, write something on it and press it against the glass. It reads, 'You are in a helicopter!'</p>

<p>The pilot gives them a smile and a jaunty salute, turns 223 degrees and heads straight for Boeing Field, where he lands. </p>

<p>"But," says the astonished passenger, "How did you suddenly know where we were?"</p>

<p>"Oh," says the pilot, "As soon as they told me that I knew I was at Microsoft headquarters - because what they told me was technically accurate, yet totally fucking worthless."</p>

<p>Amen. </p>
