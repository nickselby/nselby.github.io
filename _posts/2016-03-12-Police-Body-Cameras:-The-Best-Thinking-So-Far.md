<h1>Police Body Cameras: The Best Thinking So Far </h1>
<p><img class="left" width="400px" src="https://nselby.github.io/assets/img/body_cameras.png" /></p>

<p>For the past year and a half, Americans have been very interested in police body cameras - most specifically, why more cops don't have them. As I go around the country having conversations with police agencies and citizens, they're often as shocked to hear that, in 2013, while 81% of police officers have TASERs, only about a third (32%) have body cameras<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5321" target="_blank">BJS NCJ 248767</a>, Dr. Brian A. Reaves, July 7, 2015</span>.</p>

<p>While you'd expect that number to have increased by this year, it's an interesting data-point that according to <a href="http://streetcredsoftware.com/pkic" target="_blank">StreetCred Police Killings in Context</a> data, video was only available in 26% of cases in which a police officer killed an unarmed civilian. And while most people know that, in two 2015 cases, witness video was crucial to show officers were not truthful with investigators, most <em>don't</em> know that it fully exonerated the officers in two other 2015 cases.</p>

<p>What is most surprising is that, in all four of these cases, video was photographed by bystanders or surveillance cameras, <em>not police video</em>.</p>

<p>About a year and a half ago I <a href="https://medium.com/@nselby/barriers-to-officer-worn-video-the-ten-per-cent-challenge-50391ed9d688#.jlouj8bj4" target="_blank">wrote a fairly long blog post</a> about the main barriers to police video, which I considered to be generally grouped in the areas of Standards & Guidance, Bandwidth & Access Control, Integrity, Storage & Retention, and funding. Now Professor Elizabeth Joh has written the first draft of what will certainly become a truly great paper on the subject<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Joh, Elizabeth. "<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2744159" target="_blank">Beyond Surveillance: Data Control and Body Cameras</a>." Surveillance and Society, 9 Mar. 2016.</span>. I figured that, since she did that, I'd riff on some of my thoughts about some of her thoughts. </p>

<p>Whaddaya think?</p> 

<h3>Who controls the data?</h3>
Joh focuses her paper on the important questions around the data - how it is created, processed, and stored. As a part of this she refers briefly to the physical form factor of the device, including this brilliant and insightful observation:

<blockquote>The very design of a police body camera can influence the resulting data. Seemingly mundane questions of equipment design and cost can shape the information produced.</blockquote>

<p><img class="right" width="400px" src="https://nselby.github.io/assets/img/reveal.png" />This is a huge issue that doesn't get considered that often, and is really at odds with the way American policing tends to buy equipment. US cops like to buy the same equipment for everyone, and that is limiting, especially when, sometimes, the kind of camera that might be right for many officers (the Reveal camera here, developed in the UK with a UK design sensibility based primarily around UK societal privacy expectatiions) might be great for a range of activities in which it's fine to let people know you are recording. But in many US use-cases, the sight of oneself on video might very well be provocative to those being policed.</p>

<p>Paying close attention to the physical form factor is also important when it comes to a range of non-obvious police activities and assignments. And, as Joh notes, with just two vendors<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">TASER International and VieVu</span> dominating the space, this has a stifling effect on choice here. I don't expect to solve this issue, but I note that Joh is absolutely on to something that is the center of conversations throughout the American policing community.</p>
