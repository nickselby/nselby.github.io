<h1>Police Body Cameras: The Best Thinking So Far </h1>
<p><img class="left" width="400px" src="https://nselby.github.io/assets/img/body_cameras.png" /></p>

<p>For the past year and a half, Americans have been very interested in police body cameras - most specifically, why more cops don't have them. As I go around the country having conversations with police agencies and citizens, they're often as shocked to hear that, in 2013, while 81% of police officers have TASERs, only about a third (32%) have body cameras<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5321" target="_blank">BJS NCJ 248767</a>, Dr. Brian A. Reaves, July 7, 2015</span>.</p>

<p>While you'd expect that number to have increased by this year, it's an interesting data-point that according to <a href="http://streetcredsoftware.com/pkic" target="_blank">StreetCred Police Killings in Context</a> data, video was only available in 26% of cases in which a police officer killed an unarmed civilian. And while most people know that, in two 2015 cases, witness video was crucial to show officers were not truthful with investigators, most <em>don't</em> know that it fully exonerated the officers in two other 2015 cases.</p>

<p>What is most surprising is that, in all four of these cases, video was photographed by bystanders or surveillance cameras, <em>not police video</em>.</p>

<p>About a year and a half ago I <a href="https://medium.com/@nselby/barriers-to-officer-worn-video-the-ten-per-cent-challenge-50391ed9d688#.jlouj8bj4" target="_blank">wrote a fairly long blog post</a> about the main barriers to police video, which I considered to be generally grouped in the areas of Standards & Guidance, Bandwidth & Access Control, Integrity, Storage & Retention, and funding. Now Professor Elizabeth Joh has written the first draft of what will certainly become a truly great paper on the subject<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Joh, Elizabeth. "<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2744159" target="_blank">Beyond Surveillance: Data Control and Body Cameras</a>." Surveillance and Society, 9 Mar. 2016.</span>. I figured that, since she did that, I'd riff on some of my thoughts about some of her thoughts. </p>

<p>Whaddaya think?</p> 

<h3>Who controls the data?</h3>
Joh focuses her paper on the important questions around the data - how it is created, processed, and stored.
