<p>Since we launched the StreetCred Police Killings in Context database last month, the response has been really interesting in the world of law enforcement. The engagement with agencies and administrators, and with industry groups (watch this space) has been truly gratifying. </p>

The Washington Post’s Distraught People, Deadly Results visualization 

The single most common question we get from readers is, “What do you mean, ‘Context’”? That’s important. The Washington Post recognizes the importance of context, and to that end, in their database of police shootings, they differentiate in graphics between decedents with “signs of mental illness,” and those without. WaPo does not, on the page on which these graphics appear, define its criteria for determining “signs of mental illness.” 

Context is important especially in light of comments from the FBI and the Department of Justice. This week, the Washington Post reported that FBI Director James B. Comey told a law enforcement meeting that, “It is unacceptable that The Washington Post and the Guardian newspaper from the U.K. are becoming the lead source of information about violent encounters between police and civilians. That is not good for anybody.” 

He’s right. As was Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who told PBS News Hour’s Gwen Ifell, “We find it unacceptable that we don’t have national, consistent data about not just excessive force, but officer-involved deaths, officer-involved shootings. This information is important because, with it, we can pinpoint trends, we can look at how situations devolve from a standard interaction into one that’s less positive or perhaps fatal.” 

She’s right, too. 

But data is just data — it’s not information, and if it is not correctly analyzed and leveraged, it’s just another database. I’ve written about this in the past. 

As far as data on police use of force, StreetCred thinks that it’s very important to keep track of all police use of force. In July, I wrote on that subject: 

I believe that the wrongful death of a citizen at the hands of a police officer is among the gravest of crimes; it is a betrayal of society’s most fundamental compact, and an abdication of the officer’s sworn responsibility to protect and serve. It is truly important that civilians maintain accurate records of the killings and uses of force by their police, to understand why these occur. 

The Washington Post plays it straight, and tries to provide a tremendous and tremendously important service. They limit themselves to only those shot and killed by police, and provide context only on mental illness, for sound and admirable logistical reasons — do one thing, do it very well and move on to the next thing. As sensible as the Five Guys’ burger strategy. 

While The Guardian goes well past that, and well past what is reasonable (for example, including deaths in prison, even though no police are involved with prisons either in this country or in the UK), other projects, notably the Fatal Encounters project, gather information on thousands of deaths after confrontations with police over the years. 

However, just stacking up numbers ignores what Attorney General Lynch and Director Comey want the data for — they and we seek to find patterns in the data to reduce the frequency of these incidents. 

Because we want to fix the problems. 

To be able to better use the numbers, we as data projects and gatherers should provide enough contextual data — facts, not interpretation — to allow researchers to reach conclusions that will help them separate incidents in which the police appear to have behaved poorly — using excessive or deadly force where it was not required — from other incidents. 

To begin to create that dataset, we must look at police killings of the unarmed. That is what the StreetCred PKIC project does. 

Now, as the 902 US persons murdered in 2011 by being beaten to death with hands, fists, feet; or who were victims of “strangulation” or “asphyxiation” can attest, “unarmed” does not by itself mean that someone is not engaged in an act of deadly physical force. And of course, someone can be armed and not engaged in a use of deadly physical force — if I am legally carrying a holstered and concealed gun in the supermarket while I squeeze the tomatoes, I’m armed but certainly not dangerous. 

The problem with well-intentioned datasets like The Washington Post’s isn’t just that it only counts incidents in which the police shoot someone to death. It’s also that there’s no way for users like researchers or activists or journalists or police to quickly distinguish between incidents in which the cops came to the delight of everyone, and those in which people believe, or conditions seem as if, the cop overstepped his authority and committed a crime. 

As the most obvious example, there’s just no way without reading the full cases and coverage of each story for a user to distinguish in Washington Post data (or that of The Guardian for that matter) the difference between Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez and Felix Kumi. Yet those men, who both died at the hands of police officers, provide good examples of the approximate edges of the continuum we see with officer-involved deaths. In The Post’s count, they’re just “guys shot by cops.” In their graphic, you can see that one exhibited, “signs of mental illness”. 

In the Guardian, they’re just “‘black’ and ‘Arab-American’ men shot by cops.” 

With context, however, it is clear at a glance that something is different. 

Mr. Kumi, it turns out, was a completely avoidable, and tragic accident. An innocent bystander, Mr. Kumi was hit by accidental fire when police fired at — and missed — a completely unrelated group that was selling guns and trying to rob (at gunpoint) the undercover officers who were attempting to buy those guns in a sting. 

Mr Abdulazeez, you may have heard, was the mass murderer who killed four Marines and sailor during his rampage in Chattanooga this July. He injured others and would have killed more people, had the police not killed him. He needed to be stopped, and there are few among the reasonable who do not thank God the cops were there — in fact, why the hell couldn’t they have got there just a little sooner? 

That both died by police gunfire is absolutely correct. But anyone can see how to simply label both these men as, “Men shot and killed by police,” is at the very least unhelpful. Some context is necessary to go from merely “true” to “helpful.” 

Not buried in the fine print, or placed into the website javascript popups, but not within the raw data (as in the case of The Guardian). But right in the data itself. 

 

A section from the StreetCred PKIC documentation covering definitions of terms and columns used in the dataset. 

If we want to provide researchers, community leaders, activists, police administrators, sociologists and journalists the tools with which to frame public debate and the data in which to seek patterns, we simply must provide contextual data. 

And when we do provide information on mental illness, we must differentiate in our methodology whether we mean an extant, prior diagnosis of a mental illness, or whether the person simply was “apparently” mentally ill. StreetCred PKIC makes this distinction, and provides a guide in its, “Data Columns Explained” page within the project documentation. 

Categories for contextual data on those killed by police just really has to include an “Intoxicated” category, with sub-categories of “Alcohol” and “Narcotics” and “Prescription drugs” and “Marijuana”. Possibly with a sub-category of “methamphetamine” since meth itself is responsible for so many encounters and deadly encounters with law enforcement. 

In the StreetCred PKIC data, we see that, of the unarmed people killed by police in the first eight months of 2015, 27% per-cent — more than one in every four — were under the influence of non-prescription narcotics such as cocaine, heroin, flakka; 10% had taken methamphetamine, and 7% of decedents had ingested alcohol. This is important. 

Some categories about the activity in which the deceased was engaging would also reduce uncertainty: the idea is to fully isolate people who are killed by police while engaging in criminal offenses versus those who were not — and while that sounds difficult, it is likely not. 

“Traffic offense” is a real red flag here for “possibly chickenshit,” but “maybe not”. Twenty five percent of the 125 unarmed people killed by police in our study were stopped for traffic infractions. It is also true that, “Engaging in assault of officer,” “engaging in assault of civilians,” “engaging in vandalism or burglary,” “engaging in robbery,” are highly specific and give you an immediate flavor of how this person came in contact with authorities — without placing the responsibility for establishing justification on the part of StreetCred PKIC, or the Washington Post or of The Counted. It brings transparency and allows for sorting. And it relies on facts, not interpretation. 

Other categories could include, “Domestic violence”, “dispute,” “attempting to flee arrest,” etc. And we should add a category for, “Witnesses support police account,” and one for “Witnesses dispute police account.” 

The context comes from facts, and it allow researchers to quickly break up decedents into groups, based on facts like these: of 125 incidents in which police killed an unarmed civilian in the first eight months of 2015, 81 (65%) began as a response to a 911 call about a violent-crime (robbery, carjacking, domestic violence or assault) or property crime (burglary, car theft or vandalism) in progress. Three people (2%) were wanted fugitives in the act of escape — and one was unarmed when he died but was acting as part of a gang of three who were wanted in a recent homicide. They were, at the time of the incident, in the progress of a kidnapping a woman. 

There were 26 incidents that involved an assault against another civilian before police arrived, and in two cases, the murder of other civilians, by the decedent.
