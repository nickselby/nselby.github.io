<p>Americans may have challenges with the cops, but boy, oh boy, do they watch cop shows. It’s kind of a central theme of American life.</p>

<p>Consider that, in 2014-2015, the top 50-ranked broadcast television programs for the 2014-2015 season included The Blacklist, Criminal Minds, Scorpion, NCIS, Gotham, NCIS: New Orleans, Mike &amp; Molly, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Secrets &amp; Lies, and Stalker and Elementary. NCIS: Los Angeles, Law &amp; Order Special Victims Unit, Castle, and Person Of Interest were tied at Number 54, and Chicago P.D., CSI and CSI:Cyber were tied at 61. </p>

<p>With 17.4 million viewers, NCIS: New Orleans was the most-watched new series of the season. Number two was Empire, with 17.3 million. </p>

<p>This has been true in every generation - I personally grew up watching Starsky &amp; Hutch, Baretta, Kojak, Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, re-runs of Adam-12 and Dragnet from the 1960s, and a host of other shows about the fuzz. And let’s not leave out Cop Rock - a (I am not kidding) musical police procedural drama.</p>

<p>It’s not just television: in ten of the last 15 years, there have been Top 20 grossing films with the central theme of law enforcement - either focused on those in it or avoiding it. This leaves out action films with a vaguely “law and order" theme, like the James Bond movies, or other super-hero moves, but does include comedies. In 2013, for example, we had The Heat, We’re The Millers, American Hustle and Identity Thief, all with strong themes of law enforcement or breaking the law and contending with the cops. </p>

<p>The reason I went on ad-nauseam is to drill home the central point that, while Americans believe that they understand, deep down, how police work is done, I put it to you that what they really understand is how police work is done on police television shows and movies. Americans absorb TV in alarming quantities, and this starts young: even in this new media world, television viewing dominates media consumption. The average 8 to 18 year old consumes 4:30 hours of television a day, up from 3:51 in 2004<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Rideout, Victoria J., Ulla G. Foehr, and Donald F. Roberts. "Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8-to 18-Year-Olds." Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (2010).</span>. This is despite technological advances like smart phones, phablets and tablets - as it turns out, the kids are using those devices to watch more television.</p>

<p>Children watch TV years before they can speak<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Koski, Melissa. “The Representations of Race and Ethnicity on NYPD Blue and Law &amp; Order: An Analysis of the Portrayal of New York City on Crime and Police Drama.” (2007).</span> and television, “carries important messages that can influence attitudes, actions, and the values of its viewers. Television is undoubtedly one of the most influential sources of information in our country.”<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">[Ibid.]</span></p>

<p>The problem is that it’s not true. It’s drama. It’s make-believe.</p>

<p>TV, however, molds how we think and we feel personally close to characters. What we see on TV shapes our feelings even about race relations and properties of people we have never met. In the same way, when we see police shows that show a homicide every episode, we believe that crime is more prevalent than it really is. “The social construction of reality theory suggests that because of the vividness and realness of television’s images, programs can often become part of viewers’ sense of reality,” wrote Melissa Koski<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">[Ibid.]</span>,  whose work highlighted studies of those shows against real-world crime statistics and found them skewed, sometimes dramatically.</p>

<p><blockquote>Out of all the crimes committed, whites were most often the victim on the programs. Hispanics, however, made up 38% of the victims shown on the programs while blacks were not shown as victims of any type of crime in any of the episodes. Real life data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reveals the percentage of homicide victims by race from 1990-1995 (when the programs were broadcast) as very different from the programs’ homicide victims (“Bureau of Justice Statistics,” 2006). From 1990-1995, blacks made up over 50% of homicide victims, while whites were 46%. The data did not include specifically Hispanic victims, but the “other” category made up 2% of homicide victims. On the episodes studied, whites made up 100% of the homicide victims: blacks were never victims and Hispanics were only victims of non-deadly crimes.</blockquote></p>

<p>“Gerbner (1980) explains that television often portrays crime as a frequent event that may lead viewers to believe crime is more prevalent than statistics actually indicate. He also states that viewers find crime portrayed on television as significantly more violent, random, and dangerous than crime in the “real-world”. This distorted reflection of reality then leads viewers to internalize these images and develop a “mean world view” that is often characterized by mistrust, cynicism, alienation, and fear. Unfortunately this world view is often transferred toward law enforcement figures, who are often the most public representatives of the Criminal Justice System.”<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Gerbner, G., et al, quoted in Ford, I. V., and T. George. “Media Influences and Student Attitudes Toward Law Enforcement Figures Within Northeast Tennessee.” (2013).</span></p>

<p>Studies have also that while TV violence was directly related to fear of crime, there ws significant correlation of TV crime to actual crime<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Jamieson, Patrick E., and Daniel Romer. “Violence in popular US prime time TV dramas and the cultivation of fear: A time series analysis.” Media and Communication 2.2 (2014): 31.</span></p>

<p>I think if I were to ask anyone over age 30 the name of the detective who was Greek and sucked on lollipops, or when Andy Sipowicz broke his sobriety, or which precinct Frank Furillo worked, or the name of the show on which Ponch and Jon rode motorcycles, we’d get some pretty quick answers. </p>

<p>So now that we’ve walked down memory lane let me ask you whether you know the answers to these ten basic questions about police use of deadly force:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do you know how Tennessee v. Garner applies to law enforcement use of deadly force?</li>
  <li>Do you know what Graham v. Connor is?</li>
  <li>Do you know what qualified immunity is? </li>
  <li>Must an officer be able to distinguish between a toy gun and a real gun before firing? </li>
  <li>Do you know whether the Fourth Amendment has to do with protecting us against being killed by the police? </li>
  <li>Do you know whether a TASER is non-deadly force, or deadly force? </li>
  <li>Should officers fire a warning shot, if time allows?</li>
  <li>Do you know what Forrett v Richardson was? And how it affects officers’ use of force?</li>
  <li>Does an officer need to wait until a person has fired at him before the officer may defend himself?</li>
  <li>Do you understand your rights when you are stopped and frisked? Have you heard of Terry v. Ohio? Do you understand the limits on officers during a "Terry stop"?</li>
 </ol>

<p>How’d you do? Let me ask you to consider this: if you were unsure, or even got fewer than half of those right, how well do you <em>really</em> understand police use of force? Or police use of deadly force? Or police investigations into officer-involved deaths? </p>

<p>Have you ever seen, personally, a cop stand up for another cop who broke the law? Think to the last time you heard of this - cops illegally standing up for another cop. Was it on the news? Or was it on a television show? Both happen, don't get me wrong, but it happens much more often on TV than in real life. </p>

<p>So after all that, I cannot answer this next question - only you can: Do you really understand these issues of use of force, use of deadly force? Or did you just <em>feel</em> as if you had a handle on it, because, perhaps, of the thousands of hours of television police programs you’ve watched?</p>

<p>Next time you have an immediate reaction to something about the cops you see on TV, I can only ask you to stop, and ask yourself whether you feel you personally understand the laws, tactics, techniques and procedures used by the police, and the issues at stake, enough to have an opinion. And if not, <em>ask</em> someone. Ask a cop, ask a lawyer, ask a prosecutor or public defender; ask a judge. Ask a criminal justice student or law student. Find out enough to take the fight to the cops when they abuse their authority. </p>

<p>Argue from a standpoint of substance, not Starsky &amp; Hutch.</p>
