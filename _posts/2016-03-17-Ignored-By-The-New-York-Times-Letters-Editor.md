<p>TO THE EDITOR:<br />
Sometimes police arrest a black person, and race has nothing to do with it. Such was the case with Princeton Prof. Imani Perry (“<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/us/police-release-video-of-traffic-stop-of-princeton-professor.html" target="_blank">Police release video of traffic stop of Princeton professor</a>,” Feb. 11).</p>

<p>Princeton, N.J., police pulled Perry over for allegedly driving 67 mph in a 45 mph zone. They then discovered she had a suspended license and a warrant for her arrest. They took her into custody.</p>

<p>Perry posted online, “The fact of my blackness is not incidental to this matter.”</p>

<p>The available evidence says otherwise. The officers had documented and well-articulated probable cause. The video shows they were polite and respectful, and rightly took the professor to jail after showing her all manner of courtesy.</p>

<p>The New York Times insinuates that Princeton police stop a disproportionately large number of black people compared to the population. As usual this the insinuation of racism fails, however, because not all drivers in Princeton live in Princeton.</p>

<p>Forcing legitimate law enforcement acts into a narrative of racism hinders an honest and necessary national dialogue about race.</p>
