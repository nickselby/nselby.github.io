<h1>No Matter What Happens, Releasing The Video Is The Right Thing To Do</h1>
<p><img class="right" width="500px" src="https://nselby.github.io/assets/img/charlotte-presser.jpg" /></p>


I am thrilled that Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney has decided to release police video of the officer-involved shooting of Keith Scott. It is absolutely essential - even if it leads temporarily to more unrest. 

The very first key finding from our book, <a href="http://amzn.to/1q0pkXx" target="_blank">In Context: Understanding Police Killings of Unarmed Civilians</a> spoke as much to the whole country as to Charlotte:

“Law enforcement agencies simply must find better ways to release more data, and to release it earlier,” we said. 

“There is a significant public interest in this data, and the public has a legitimate right to understand how it is being policed. 

“We call for agencies to release more data, more quickly. In America, we believe that sunlight is the best cure for most challenges between government and the people. 

“Police agencies failing to release information look like they’re hiding something, and alternatively, agencies that release what they have, when they have it are invested with the trust of their communities.”

That key finding, to us, was more important than the findings that mental illness and drug use and poverty were better predictors of fatal encounters with police than race, or that there was no defined pattern of systemic bias. 

Cops sharing information about officer involved shootings is the single most important thing they must do to keep or earn the trust of their communities. 

Withholding the video was a really bad idea. 

Chief Putney has done a good job describing the incident, but he is facing an entrenched narrative that contradicts him directly. I believe him completely, but lots of people don’t. 

On Wednesday, I spoke at the <a href="http://www.iaca.net/conference.asp" target="_blank">International Association of Crime Analyst</a> conference in Louisville and had the conversation about this finding. I mentioned the prime example of how to do it right: Las Vegas. 

Vegas had a lot of issues, and when they worked with DOJ one of the best suggestions ever was that they do a brain dump 48 hours after an officer involved shooting: here is everything we know now: names, video, 911 calls, transcripts, interviews...everything. 

It was <a href="http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2015/11/03/walter-katz-named-san-joses-next-independent-police-auditor/" target="_blank">Walter Katz</a> who first told me about Vegas, and when I looked in to it he was exactly right. I’ve spoken with many surprised officers and analysts in Vegas and they all agree: when Vegas started the 48-hour brain-dumps it bought them, over time, the respect of the community and the media, and the trust of both - to the extent that now, when they must say something like, “Oh, sorry, we will release that in a couple of days, we had some challenges,” they are believed, and people do not get upset. 

They have established a baseline of trustworthy activity. I spoke with a senior Vegas analyst who told me that has been exactly the case, and that he was really surprised at how effective it has been. 

Here’s something else that Walter pointed out – I call it the Katz Condition: Last year there were no indictments of officers in killings of unarmed people unless video was made of the killing. There was only video in 25% of the 153 cases. 

Think about that: in every case there was an indictment, there was video. In no case where no video was available was there an indictment. 

Now think of Charlotte: we have “inconclusive” video, but a chief insisting that the evidence shows Scott had a gun and not a book. Not releasing video is the department shooting itself in the foot.

I am thankful they have decided to release it. Come what may, it’s better than not releasing it.
